## Internet

The Internet is a global network of computers that are interconnected and communicate with each other using standardized protocols. It allows users to access and share information from anywhere in the world.

In simple words, The Internet is like a huge web that connects computers, smartphones, and other devices. Through it, you can:

- Browse websites
- Send emails
- Use social media
- Stream videos or music
- Chat and call people
- Play online games
- Access cloud services

### How it Works ?

- Your device connects to the Internet through an Internet Service Provider (ISP).
- Data is broken into small pieces called packets and sent across the network using protocols like TCP/IP.
- These packets travel through routers and servers to reach their destination.
- The device at the other end receives the packets and reassembles them.

### Key components

- **Servers** – computers that store websites and content.
- **Clients** – devices like your phone or laptop that request data.
- **Protocols** – rules for data transmission (like HTTP, TCP/IP).
- **IP addresses** – unique numbers assigned to every device.

#### Not to be confused with

- **World Wide Web (WWW)**: A service that runs on the Internet (websites, links, etc.).
- The Internet is the infrastructure, the Web is one of the services that uses it.
