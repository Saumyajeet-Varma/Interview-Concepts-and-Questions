# What is React JS ?

React JS (commonly referred to as just "React") is an open-source JavaScript library developed and maintained by Facebook (now Meta) for building user interfaces, particularly single-page applications. Unlike full frameworks like Angular, React focuses specifically on the view layer of applications, making it more flexible and easier to integrate with other technologies.

## Key Characteristics of React

**Component-Based Architecture**: React applications are built using components—independent, reusable pieces of code that return HTML via a render function.

**Declarative Approach**: You tell React what you want to achieve, and it handles the DOM updates to match that state.

**Virtual DOM**: React creates a lightweight representation of the real DOM in memory, which helps optimize rendering performance.

**Unidirectional Data Flow**: Data in React flows in one direction, from parent components to child components, making applications more predictable and easier to debug.

**JSX Syntax**: React uses JSX, a syntax extension that allows you to write HTML-like code in your JavaScript.

# Why Use React?

## Performance

React's implementation of a virtual DOM significantly improves performance compared to directly manipulating the browser's DOM. When your data changes, React first updates its virtual DOM, compares it with the previous version (a process called "diffing"), and then efficiently updates only the necessary parts of the actual DOM.

## Component Reusability

The component-based architecture of React promotes code reuse and separation of concerns. Components can be as small as a button or as large as an entire page, and they can be composed together to build complex UIs.

## Hot Module Replacement (HMR)

HMR lets you update parts of your app instantly in the browser without losing the current state.
When you're developing with React (or other modern frameworks), and you change a file (like a component or a style), HMR updates just that module without doing a full page reload.

# Core Concepts in React

## Components

Components are the building blocks of any React application. They are self-contained pieces of code that encapsulate HTML, CSS, and JavaScript which can be reused throughout the application.

There are two types of components in React:

### 1. **Class-based Components**

> Before React 16.8

- You write a class that extends React.Component.
- You must have a render() method that returns JSX.
- You manage state and lifecycle methods (like componentDidMount, componentDidUpdate) inside the class.

```javascript
import React, { Component } from 'react';

class HelloWorld extends Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = { message: "Hello, World!" };
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <h1>{this.state.message}</h1>
    );
  }
}

export default HelloWorld;
```

### 2. **Functional Components**

> After React 16.8

- Just a function that returns JSX.
- With Hooks (like useState, useEffect), functional components can do everything class components can — but with less code and better readability.

```javascript
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function HelloWorld() {
  const [message, setMessage] = useState("Hello, World!");

  return (
    <h1>{message}</h1>
  );
}

export default HelloWorld;
```
 
| Feature                 | Class Component                  | Functional Component        |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------------|------------------------------|
| Syntax                   | `class` with `render()`           | Simple `function`            |
| State Management         | `this.state`, `this.setState()`   | `useState()` hook            |
| Lifecycle Methods        | `componentDidMount()`, etc.       | `useEffect()` hook           |
| Code Readability         | More complex, more boilerplate    | Cleaner, shorter             |
| Modern Usage             | Less recommended for new apps    | Highly recommended        |

## JSX

JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript that looks similar to HTML. It allows you to write HTML-like code in your JavaScript files, making it easier to visualize the UI you're building.

```javascript
const element = <h1>Hello, world!</h1>;
```

This is neither a string nor HTML but JSX, which gets compiled to regular JavaScript function calls. Behind the scenes, the above JSX translates to:

```javascript
const element = React.createElement('h1', null, 'Hello, world!');
```

## Props

Props (short for "properties") are how components receive data from their parent. They are read-only and help make components reusable.

```javascript
function Welcome(props) {
  return <h1>Hello, {props.name}</h1>;
}

// Usage
<Welcome name="Sara" />;
```

## State

State is a JavaScript object that stores data that may change over time and affects the component's rendering. Unlike props, state is managed within the component.

**In class components:**

```javascript
class Counter extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = { count: 0 };
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <p>You clicked {this.state.count} times</p>
        <button onClick={() => this.setState({ count: this.state.count + 1 })}>
          Click me
        </button>
      </div>
    );
  }
}
```

**In functional components with hooks**

```javascript
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>You clicked {count} times</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Click me</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Lifecycle Methods

React components have a lifecycle that includes mounting, updating, and unmounting phases. Each phase has associated methods that you can override to run code at specific times.

For class components, some key lifecycle methods include:

- **`componentDidMount()`**: Runs after the component is rendered to the DOM
- **`componentDidUpdate()`**: Runs after updates to the component
- **`componentWillUnmount()`**: Runs before the component is removed from the DOM

For functional components, with Hooks, the useEffect Hook replaces most lifecycle methods:

```javascript
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

function Example() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  // Similar to componentDidMount and componentDidUpdate:
  useEffect(() => {
    document.title = `You clicked ${count} times`;

    // Similar to componentWillUnmount:
    return () => {
      document.title = 'React App';
    };
  }, [count]); // Only re-run if count changes

  return (
    <div>
      <p>You clicked {count} times</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Click me</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

# React Hooks

Introduced in React 16.8, Hooks allow you to use state and other React features without writing a class component. They provide a more direct API to React concepts like state, context, refs, and lifecycle.

| Hook                  | Purpose                                             | Example                                |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| `useState`             | Add **state** to functional components              | Counter, form input values             |
| `useEffect`            | Handle **side effects** (like API calls, timers)    | Fetch data on mount, subscriptions     |
| `useContext`           | Access **context** values easily                    | Theme, auth status sharing             |
| `useRef`               | Reference a **DOM node** or **keep a mutable value** | Focus an input, store timer ID          |
| `useMemo`              | **Memoize** expensive calculations                  | Optimize performance                   |
| `useCallback`          | **Memoize a function** to prevent unnecessary re-renders | Callback handlers                  |
| `useReducer`           | Manage **complex state logic** (alternative to `useState`) | Like Redux inside a component    |
| `useLayoutEffect`      | Like `useEffect` but fires **before paint**          | Measure DOM nodes                      |
| `useImperativeHandle`  | Customize the instance value exposed by `ref`       | Advanced ref control                   |
| `useTransition`        | Manage **UI transitions** during slow updates       | Smooth loading UI                      |

# Virtual DOM

The Virtual DOM is a key concept that contributes to React's performance. Instead of updating the browser's DOM directly, React:

- Creates a virtual representation of the UI in memory (Virtual DOM)
- When state changes, it creates a new Virtual DOM and compares it with the previous one
- Calculates the most efficient way to update the browser's DOM
- Performs only the necessary updates to the real DOM

This process, known as reconciliation, minimizes expensive DOM operations and makes React applications fast and responsive.

# JSX in Depth

JSX is more powerful than it first appears. Here are some advanced JSX features:

## Expressions in JSX

You can embed any JavaScript expression in JSX by wrapping it in curly braces

```javascript
const name = 'Josh Perez';
const element = <h1>Hello, {name}</h1>;
```

## Conditional Rendering

You can use conditional operators or logical operators to conditionally render elements.

```javascript
function Greeting({ isLoggedIn }) {
  return (
    <div>{isLoggedIn ? <h1>Welcome back!</h1> : <h1>Please sign in.</h1>}</div>
  );
}
```

## Lists and Keys

When rendering multiple components from an array, you should include a "key" prop to help React identify which items have changed, been added, or been removed.

```javascript
function NumberList({ numbers }) {
  return (
    <ul>
      {numbers.map((number) => (
        <li key={number.toString()}>{number}</li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  );
}
```

# State Management in React

For simple applications, React's built-in state management through the useState hook or component state is often sufficient. However, as applications grow more complex, you might need more sophisticated state management solutions.

## Context API

The Context API provides a way to share data that can be considered "global" for a tree of React components, without having to pass props down manually at every level.

```javascript
// Create a context
const ThemeContext = React.createContext('light');

// Provider component
function App() {
  return (
    <ThemeContext.Provider value="dark">
      <Toolbar />
    </ThemeContext.Provider>
  );
}

// Consumer component
function ThemedButton() {
  const theme = useContext(ThemeContext);
  return <button className={theme}>Themed Button</button>;
}
```

## Redux

Redux is a popular state management library often used with React for managing complex application state. It centralizes your application's state and logic, making state changes predictable and traceable.

```javascript
// Action
const increment = () => {
  return {
    type: 'INCREMENT',
  };
};

// Reducer
const counterReducer = (state = 0, action) => {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'INCREMENT':
      return state + 1;
    default:
      return state;
  }
};

// Store
const store = createStore(counterReducer);
```

## Context API vs Redux

| Feature               | Context API                         | Redux                                |
|------------------------|-------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Purpose                | Pass data easily through component tree | Manage complex and large application state |
| Setup Complexity       | Very simple (built into React)      | More setup (store, actions, reducers) |
| Best For               | Small to medium apps, theme, user auth | Large apps with complex state logic |
| Boilerplate Code       | Minimal                            | A lot (especially without Redux Toolkit) |
| State Updates          | Synchronous                        | Synchronous (Redux-thunk/middleware for async) |
| DevTools Support       | Limited                            | Powerful Redux DevTools extension    |
| Performance            | Can cause unnecessary re-renders if not optimized | Optimized with reducers and middleware |
| Learning Curve         | Easy                                | Steeper                              |
| External Dependencies  | None                               | Yes (need `redux`, `react-redux`)    |


# Routing in React

React doesn't have built-in routing, but the React Router library is commonly used to handle navigation in React applications.

```javascript
import { BrowserRouter, Routes, Route, Link } from 'react-router-dom';

function App() {
  return (
    <BrowserRouter>
      <nav>
        <Link to="/">Home</Link>
        <Link to="/about">About</Link>
      </nav>

      <Routes>
        <Route path="/" element={<Home />} />
        <Route path="/about" element={<About />} />
      </Routes>
    </BrowserRouter>
  );
}
```

# Forms in React

Handling forms in React typically involves controlled components, where form data is handled by React state.

```javascript
function NameForm() {
  const [name, setName] = useState('');

  const handleSubmit = (event) => {
    event.preventDefault();
    alert('A name was submitted: ' + name);
  };

  return (
    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
      <label>
        Name:
        <input
          type="text"
          value={name}
          onChange={(e) => setName(e.target.value)}
        />
      </label>
      <button type="submit">Submit</button>
    </form>
  );
}
```

# Server-Side Rendering (SSR)

React can be rendered on the server using Node.js, which helps with performance and SEO. Frameworks like Next.js provide an easier way to implement SSR with React.

```javascript
// server.js with Express
import express from 'express';
import React from 'react';
import { renderToString } from 'react-dom/server';
import App from './App';

const app = express();

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  const html = renderToString(<App />);

  res.send(`
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
      <head>
        <title>React SSR</title>
      </head>
      <body>
        <div id="root">${html}</div>
        <script src="/bundle.js"></script>
      </body>
    </html>
  `);
});

app.listen(3000);
```

# Best Practices in React Development

### Component Organization

- Keep components small and focused on a single responsibility
- Use a consistent naming convention (e.g., PascalCase for components)
- Organize related files together (e.g., component, styles, tests)

### Performance Optimization

- Use the React DevTools Profiler to identify performance issues
- Implement memoization with React.memo, useMemo, and useCallback
- Avoid unnecessary re-renders by structuring state properly
- Use code-splitting to reduce bundle size

### Code Style and Quality

- Follow a style guide (e.g., Airbnb React Style Guide)
- Use ESLint and Prettier for consistent code formatting
- Write unit tests for components using Jest and React Testing Library

### Accessibility

- Use semantic HTML elements
- Include proper aria attributes
- Ensure keyboard navigation works correctly
- Test with screen readers
